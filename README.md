# Python Songs API

Python songs API built for lecture quiz. User can search songs with author, get data from Deezer, view song: title, artist, album, duration, preview link and rank as JSON format (Bonus: there are also printed: API status code + headers). Also, this JSON format is saved as a single "song.json" file. Finally, all searched songs are being saved in songs.db sqlite3 database.
